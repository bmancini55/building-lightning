# Creating the `AppController` Class

Now that we have all the components built, we'll turn our attention to the primary logic controller for our application! This logic resides in the `AppController` class located in `server/domain`. This class is responsible for constructing and maintaining the chain of ownership based on paid invoices.

The constructor of this class takes a few things we've previously worked on such as:

- `IInvoiceDataMapper` - we'll use this to create and fetch invoices from our Lightning Network node
- `IMessageSigner` - we'll use this validate signatures that we receive from remote nodes
- `LinkFactory` - we'll use this to create links in our ownership chain

If you take a look at this class, you'll also notice that we have the `chain` property that maintains the list of `Link` in our application. This is where our application state will be retained in memory.

```typescript
public chain: Link[];
```

There is also a conveniently added `chaintip` property that returns the last record in the chain.

```typescript
public get chainTip(): Link {
    return this.chain[this.chain.length - 1];
}
```

One other note about our `AppController` is that it uses the `observer` pattern to notify a subscriber about changes to the chain. In this case the subscriber will be all of the open websockets. The observer will receive an array of changed `Link` whenever the chain changes. This can be found in the `listener` property on the `AppController` class.

```
 public listener: (info: Link[]) => void;
```

Dev Note: Why not use `EventEmitter`? Well we certainly could. Since this example only has a single event it's easy to bake in a handler/callback function for `Link` change events.

Lastly, this class will implement three functions that we'll discuss in more detail. These methods create a clean interface for our application logic to sit between external users (REST API and Websockets) and our Lightning Network node. These methods are:

1. `start` - this method is used to start the application and synchronize the game state with the invoices of a Lightning Network node
1. `handleInvoice` - this method is used to check invoices that are received by the Lightning Network node
1. `createInvoice` - constructs an invoice for the current `Link` based on information provided by some user.

## Starting the Application

We should now have a general understanding of the `AppController` class. A great place to begin is how we start the application. We do this with the `start` method. This method is used to bootstrap our application under two start up scenarios:

1. The first time the application is started
1. Subsequent restarts when we have some links in the chain

In either case, we need to get the game state synchronized. The synchronization requires two steps:

1. Create the first link using the `seed`
1. Synchronize the application by looking at all of our Lightning Network node's invoices using `IInvoiceDataMapper`

Back when we discussed the `IInvoiceDataMapper` we had a `sync` method. If you recall, this method accepted an `InvoiceHandler` that defined a simple function that has one argument, an `Invoice`.

```typescript
export type InvoiceHandler = (invoice: Invoice) => Promise<void>;
```

If you take a look at the `AppController`. You'll see that `handleInvoice` matches this signature! This is not a coincidence. We'll we use the `handleInvoice` method to process all invoices that our Lightning Network node knows about.

Now that we understand that, let's do an exercise and implement our `start` method.

## Exercise: Implement `start`

To implement the `start` method requires us to perform two tasks:

1. Use the `linkFactory` to create the first `Link` from the seed and add it to the `chain`
1. Once the first link is created, initiate the synchronization of invoices using the `IInvoiceDataMapper` (as mentioned, provide the `AppController.handleInvoice` method as the handler).

```typescript
public async start(seed: string, startSats: number) {
    // Exercise
}
```

Dev Tip: One of the trickier aspects of JavaScript is scoping of `this`. Since the `handleInvoice` method will be used as a callback but it belongs to the `AppController` class, special care must be made to ensure that it does not lose scope when it is called by the `sync` method. You will have an issue if you provide it directly as an argument to the `sync` method: `await this.invoiceDataMapper.sync(this.handleInvoice);`. Doing this treats the `handleInvoice` method as an unbound function, which means any use of `this` inside of that function will be scoped to the caller instead of the `AppController` class instance.

You can retain scope of the `AppController` class instance in two ways:

1. use [`bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) to bind the function to the desired scope. Eg: bind it to the current instance of the class `await this.invoiceDataMapper.sync(this.handleInvoice.bind(this))`.
1. use [`arrow functions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) which retain the scoping of the caller. Eg: `await this.invoiceDataMapper.sync(invoice => this.handleInvoice(invoice))`.

When you are finished you can verify you successfully implemented the method with the following command:

```
npm run test:server -- --grep "AppController.*start"
```

## Exercise: Implement `handleInvoice`

Next on the docket, we need to process invoices we receive from our Lightning Network node. The `handleInvoice` is called every time an invoice is found, created, or fulfilled by our Lightning Network node. This method does a few things to correctly process an invoice:

1. Checks if the invoice settles the current `Link`. Hint look at the `settles` method on the `Invoice`. If the invoice doesn't settle the current `Link`, no further action is required.
1. If the invoice does settle the current `Link`, it should call the `settle` method on `Link` which will settle the `Link`.
1. It should then create a new `Link` using the `LinkFactory.createFromSettled`.
1. It should add the new unsettled link to the application's chain
1. Finally, it will send the settled link and the new link to the listener.

This method is partially implemented for you. Complete the method by settling the current link and constructing the next link from the settled link.

```typescript
public async handleInvoice(invoice: Invoice) {
    if (invoice.settles(this.chainTip)) {
        // settle the current chain tip

        // create a new unsettled Link

        // add the new link to the chain

        // send settled and new to the listener
        if (this.listener) {
            this.listener([settled, nextLink]);
        }
    }
}
```

When you are finished you can verify you successfully implemented the method with the following command:

```
npm run test:server -- --grep "AppController.*handleInvoice"
```

## Exercise: `createInvoice`

The last bit of code `AppController` is responsible for is creating invoices. This method is responsible for interacting with the Lightning Network node's message signature verification through the `IMessageSigner` interface. It will also interact with the Lightning Network node to create the invoice via the `IInvoiceDataMapper`.

Recall that when someone wants to take ownership of the current link they'll need to send a digital signature of the current `linkId`.

Our method does a few things:

1. Verifies the signature is for the current `linkId`. If invalid, it returns a failure.
1. Constructs the preimage for the invoice. Recall that we implemented the `createPreimage` method on `Invoice` previously.
1. Constructs the memo for the invoice. Recall that we implemented the `createMemo` method on `Invoice` previously.
1. Creates the invoice using the `IInvoiceDataMapper.add` method.
1. Return a success or failure result to the caller.

This method is partially implemented for you.

```typescript
public async createInvoice(
    remoteSignature: string,
    sats: number,
): Promise<CreateInvoiceResult> {
    // verify the invoice provided by the user
    const verification = await this.signer.verify(this.chainTip.linkId, remoteSignature);

    // return failure if signature fails
    if (!verification.valid) {
        return { success: false, error: "Invalid signature" };
    }

    // Exercise: create the preimage

    // Exercise: create the memo

    // try to create the invoice
    try {
        const paymentRequest = await this.invoiceDataMapper.add(sats, memo, preimage);
        return {
            success: true,
            paymentRequest,
        };
    } catch (ex) {
        return {
            success: false,
            error: ex.message,
        };
    }
}

```

When you are finished you can verify you successfully implemented the method with the following command:

```
npm run test:server -- --grep "AppController.*createInvoice"
```
